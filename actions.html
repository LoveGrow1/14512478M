        <h4>Emotional Support:</h4>
        <p>Practice active listening when your partner expresses feelings of sadness or upset. Validate her emotions and let her know you are there for her, even if a solution isn't readily available. This can be challenging as the instinct may be to 'fix' the problem, but remember it's about shared understanding.</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Physical Closeness:</h4>
        <p>Initiate a calm, open discussion about physical intimacy and ensure it's a judgement-free zone. Discuss what you both like, what could change, and how to achieve this. Be open to both giving and receiving feedback.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Family Time:</h4>
        <p>Given you've been together for 132 months and have 3 kids, it's important to make sure the relationship maintains its priority. Plan a regular date night, even if it's at home after the kids are asleep. Make it about connecting with each other as partners, not just parents.</p>
